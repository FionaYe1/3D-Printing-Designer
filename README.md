# 3D-Printing-Designer
In this project, we proposed to build a generative adversarial network (GAN) that could generate point clouds for 3D printing based on 2D image collections. Required input for our network would be 3 images of a household item from different views and a point cloud that could be transformed to STL files containing 3D models was expected to be the output.
